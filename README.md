As part of an Artificial Intelligence course at St. Michael's College, I constructed this expert system to read in NFL games, analyze them, and predict the outcomes of future games.
My professor said that this program had the most accuracy and best code organization of any in my class.

As noted in the header of each Java file, the program works like this:

>Game.java takes in 'pros2015new.doc' and 'NFLteams.txt' and processes the files to create the games[] and teams[] arrays.
  
>Work.java is where the expert system takes shape. Using the first 224 games of the season as training data, the expert system predicts the outcomes of the last 32 games.
  
>Finally, Output.java evaluates the accuracy of the system's predictions and formats textual output to communicate the result of each prediction, as well as the system's overall accuracy, to the user (in this case, my professor).
  
The results of running the program on the 2015 NFL season are stored in Results.docx. Overall, the system predicted about 80% of the games in the season correctly, making it the most accurate system in the class.
Feel free to email me at cobrien3@mail.smcvt.edu with any questions on the development of this expert system.

This application was written in February 2016 using an IDE called JGrasp.

Enjoy!
